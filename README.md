Experimental and patched an all major AC(s)

Used to work on the burger company but recently patched aswell. They are way too accurate.

It will initialize 4 "Unknown Disk" for meme purposes.

If you want to make it work again, taking control of the disk above are mandatory, good luck have fun.

It will eventually fuck the boot time on this state, this is also fixable.
